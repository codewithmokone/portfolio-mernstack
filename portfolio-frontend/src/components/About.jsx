              My Journey

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Hi, I'm Simon Lephoto â€” a passionate Full Stack Developer with a solid 
              foundation in both front-end and back-end development. I have a Diploma 
              in Information Technology, Certificate in React Development, where I 
              developed a strong interest in building intuitive, responsive web 
              applications and solving real-world problems through code.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              During my studies, I honed my skills in technologies like JavaScript, React, 
              Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, while also gaining experience with HTML, CSS, 
              SQL, Git, and modern development tools. I've worked on several academic and 
              personal projects that showcase my ability to design, develop, and deploy 
              full-stack applications from the ground up.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              What sets me apart is my curiosity and eagerness to learn. I'm always exploring 
              new frameworks, keeping up with the latest trends in web development, and looking 
              for opportunities to grow. Whether it's collaborating with a team or tackling a solo 
              project, I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code and delivering thoughtful 
              user experiences.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Right now, I'm looking for exciting opportunities where I can contribute, learn 
              from experienced developers, and continue building impactful digital solutions.
